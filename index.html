      <p>
        VPS hosting, or Virtual Private Server hosting, is a type of web hosting that uses virtualization technology to provide you with dedicated (private) resources on a server with multiple users. It's a more secure and stable solution than shared hosting where you don't get a dedicated server space. VPS hosting is often chosen by website owners who have outgrown shared hosting but don't need the resources of a dedicated server.
